# Cipher Zero Protocol Frontend v2

## Overview

Welcome to the Cipher Zero Protocol Frontend v2! This next-generation decentralized application (dApp) provides a secure, private, and efficient platform for file sharing and messaging across blockchain networks. Built on Solana and leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques, our frontend offers a seamless user experience while prioritizing privacy and security.

## Key Features

- **Client-Side ZK Compression**: Innovative data compression using zero-knowledge proofs, reducing transaction sizes and improving efficiency.
- **Secure File Sharing**: End-to-end encrypted file transfer using enhanced BitTorrent integration.
- **Private Messaging**: zk-SNARK powered messaging system for confidential communications.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Seamless asset and data transfer across multiple blockchains via Wormhole integration.
- **Solana Integration**: High-speed, low-cost transactions leveraging Solana's blockchain.
- **Neon EVM Compatibility**: Support for Ethereum-based smart contracts and tools.

## Client-Side ZK Compression

Our standout feature is the implementation of client-side ZK (Zero-Knowledge) compression. This cutting-edge technology allows for:

- Significant reduction in data size before on-chain storage or transmission
- Enhanced privacy by compressing data without revealing its contents
- Improved scalability and reduced transaction costs on the Solana blockchain

The ZK compression is performed entirely on the client-side, ensuring that uncompressed data never leaves the user's device. This approach provides an additional layer of security and privacy for our users.

## Technology Stack

- React.js
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- @lightprotocol/stateless.js (for ZK compression)
- @solana/web3.js
- Tailwind CSS

Cipher Zero Protocol - Redefining secure and private data sharing in the blockchain era.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
